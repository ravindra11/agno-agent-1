# Agno
Agno is a lightweight library for building Multimodal agents.
It exposes LLMs as a unified API and gives them superpowers like mmemory, knowledge, tools and reasoning.

 - Builds lightning-fast Agents that can generate text, image, audio and video.

 - Add memory, knowledge, tools, and reasoning as needed.
  
 - Run anywhere, Agno is open-source

 # Key features
 - Lightning-fast: Agent creation is super fast
 - Model Agnostic: Use any model, any provider, no lock-in
 - Multi Modal: Native support for text, image, audio and video
 - Multi Agent: Build teams of specialized agents
 - Memory Management: Store agent sessions and state in a database
 - Knowledge Stores: Use vector databses for RAG or dynamic few-shot learning
 - Structured Outputs: Make Agents respond in a structured format
 - Monitoring: Track agent sessions and performance in real-time on agno.com

# Agents
 Agents are intelligent programs that solve problems autonomously.

 Agents have memory, domain knowledge and the ability to use tools (like searching the web, querying a database, making API calls). Unlike traditional programs that follow a predefined execution path, Agents dynamically adapt their approach based on the context and tool results.

 Instead of a rigid binary defination, lets think of Agents in terms of agency and autonomy

  - Level 0 : Agents with no tools (basic inference tasks).
  - Level 1 : Agents with tools for autonomous task execution.
  - Level 2 : Agents with Knowledge, combining memory and reasoning.
  - Level 3 : Teams of specialized agents collaborating on complex workflows.
